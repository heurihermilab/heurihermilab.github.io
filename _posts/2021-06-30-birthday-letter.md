> **Hello,**

> I too am on SoundCloud, and today I was looking at, as a sort of random action, the followed artists of the artist who recently followed me, παθογόνος Δράση, and clicked your profile to hear what music you had made or linked. As I was looking at your SC-linked website, kbhta.gr, I discovered that you and I were born on the same day in 1961.
>
> Now this is all on the Internet, a home of many many many lies, and I am not sure how I could possibly establish with certainty that I was, indeed, born on the XXth here in the USA. I would consider it perfectly normal, even wise, if you were to consider this possibility with a skeptical eye.
>
> Still, my discovery, as a notable birth anniversary approaches, of another electronic musician born the exact same day as myself, brought me a great pleasure at this world I live on in all its multitudinous variation. Mathematically our shared birth-date is merely a rare coincidence, not at all an impossible thing, but I thoroughly enjoy it nonetheless.
>
> I've never been to Australia or Germany, and even if I had I still know nothing about you or your life, so please accept my apologies if I am rude. But may I congratulate you on reaching your 60th year? It seems like a real achievement on my part to survive and continue to make music, so I believe the same of yourself, and wish that you too have survived the pandemic as best you can, and hope to hear more.
>
> Yes, I am more or less a random person on the Internet, and of little importance compared to almost anybody, but I enjoyed hearing what you've made, and I think that is worth passing on.
>
> Wishing you good health, and excellent circumstances,
> Carl J.
