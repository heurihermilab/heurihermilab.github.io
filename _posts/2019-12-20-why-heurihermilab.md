**Names are important.** They’re like handles for ideas. When I named my place of work Heurihermilab, I was trying to bring together three ideas:

* **heuri**, from *heuristic*

Heuristics are general rules of thumb that can be used to make decisions. They are often incomplete but over time can form the basis of full understanding.

* **hermi**, from *hermetic*

Hermeticism is a philosophical tradition associated with the development of early science, with echoes of hermetic as in “an airtight seal.”

* **lab**, short for *laboratory*

A laboratory is a place for experiments, research, teaching, or manufacture.

I pronounce it _**hyur-uh-herm-uh-lab**_.
