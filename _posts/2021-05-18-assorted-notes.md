## Liner notes for *Assorted*, published 2021.

![Assorted-front-cover.jpg](/assets/images/Assorted-front-cover.jpg)

In preparation for another project, I decided to collect some pieces, with an emphasis on accessible styles (more or less, I can't help stretching the boundaries).  Likening it to the eclectic and unplanned groupings that you find at the thrift shops, I called it *Assorted*.

## Track notes

01 — **Skataduk** [2014] 2:11 

Dedicated to the memory of Jay S and Randy B — may your friendship transcend mere lifetimes...

02 — **Brainfreeze** [2015] 1:51

Featuring the voice of Richard Shaver, of Shaver Mystery fame.

03 — **Z-Rays** [2013] 2:12

Featuring the voice of Raymond Massey. Oddly enough, the same dialogue is used for a pre-showing interstitial at a nearby movie theater.

04 — **Lixsome (Crystal Ball)** [2013] 2:21

An attempt to join drum ’n’ bass-style hyperactivity with more global spectral effects.

05 — **Kidsplay** [2015] 4:38 

06 — **Molten (Fatima #2)** [2015] 1:22

Featuring the text of the second of the Fatima revelations.

07 — **Typanosome** [2017] 2:41

Includes a field recording of birds from the backyard.

08 — **Neverlent (Night Commute)** [2000] 4:43

The spectral sounds that sound like someone bowing a sheet of steel are derived from a prominent politician of the ’90s speaking about “heroin chic”.  The bass track is an improvised first take.

09 — **At the heart altar** [2018] 3:07

Lyrics generated by A.I., et to a kind of Argentinian tango-rock.

10 — **Primed** [2014] 2:56

About television.

11 — **Codebreaker** [2018] 1:57

Total time 29:58
